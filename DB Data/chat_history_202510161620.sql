	 (3,'Bot','Based on the document, to design an algorithm, you primarily need to:

1.  **Understand the Problem:** This involves carefully reading the problem''s description, asking questions if anything is unclear, working through a few small examples by hand, and considering special cases. It''s crucial to define the exact set of instances the algorithm needs to handle to ensure it works correctly for all legitimate inputs, not just most of them.
2.  **Ascertain the Capabilities of the Computational Device:** You need to make sure your computational device can process the algorithm you plan to design. The document mentions two types of algorithms: sequential and parallel.','2025-10-13 03:46:36.4398'),

	 (3,'Bot','When we talk about ''ascertaining the capabilities of the computational device,'' it means that you need to make sure the device you plan to use is actually capable of processing the algorithm you intend to design. Essentially, it''s about checking if your computer or other device has the necessary resources and architecture to run your algorithm effectively. The text also mentions that there are different types of algorithms, like sequential and parallel, which might depend on what your device can handle.','2025-10-13 03:56:19.786404');
