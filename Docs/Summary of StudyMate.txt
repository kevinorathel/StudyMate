📌 Project Name: VisuaLearn AI
“AI-powered Interactive Learning for Complex Subjects”

🔍 What It Does & Problem It Solves

VisuaLearn AI is an AI-driven interactive tutor that helps students and professionals learn complex concepts visually and conversationally.

Imagine a student struggling with biology or engineering. They can:

Upload a diagram or document (e.g., circuit schematic, anatomy diagram, math graph).

Ask questions in natural language about the uploaded content (e.g., “What does this part of the circuit do?”).

Get step-by-step explanations, along with generated images/videos that clarify difficult ideas (like animations of how a heart pumps blood or how current flows in a transistor).

It also integrates with public education APIs (e.g., Khan Academy API
, [Wikipedia API], PubMed) to enrich answers with real-world references.

The app creates personalized summaries, quizzes, and flashcards automatically from the uploaded materials.

This solves the problem of passive learning by making study materials interactive and multimodal.

🧩 Key HuggingFace Tasks Used

Document Question Answering – Students upload slides, PDFs, or notes and ask questions directly.

Visual Question Answering – Ask about diagrams, graphs, or photos.

Image-to-Text – Extract text from notes/handwritten diagrams.

Text-to-Image / Image-to-Video – Generate explanatory visuals/animations for abstract concepts.

Summarization – Turn long PDFs or research papers into concise learning notes.

Text Classification – Auto-tag uploaded material (e.g., “Physics: Mechanics,” “Biology: Genetics”).

Translation – Make material accessible in multiple languages for global learners.
